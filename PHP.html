   <p>    PHP was created in 1994 by the Danish programmer Rasmus Lerdorf as a server side language. 
   It’s name is actually a recursive acronym “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor”. It is used almost exclusively
   on web servers due to its ability to help generate HTML documents and process form data from or into databases.
   It is an interpreted language which makes it slower than some of its counterparts, but its widespread use has made
   it an essential language to know.
