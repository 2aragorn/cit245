   <p>C++ was invented in 1979 by the Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.
   It was originally called “C with classes” because it extended and improved the 
   C language to use classes before having its name simplified to “C++” to signify 
   that it was incrementally better than C. C++ is an Object Oriented Programming 
   (OOP) language that has been used in just about every scenario imaginable from 
   desktop computers to servers to specialized software. As a compiled language for 
   all platforms its speed and versatility make it highly useful in software development.
