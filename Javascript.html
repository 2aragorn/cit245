   <p>JavaScript (or JS) is an interpreted language that was developed in 1995 by Netscape to add interactivity to static web pages.
   Itâ€™s name is misleading as it only shares a similar C-style syntax with Java and is not actually a derivative of the Java language.
   JavaScript remains an integral part of web browsers but has also been expanded to run on servers as NodeJS and on client devices 
   through wrappers such as Electron.
